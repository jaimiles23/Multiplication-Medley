Practice your times tables how you want!
- Pick the times tables to practice: "Use tables between 6 and 10."
- Answer a number of questions: "Ask me 10 questions."
- Set the lower and upper bounds (**Note below) of the times tables: "Set the lower bound to 5."

Custom Practice
- - - - - - - - - -
In this mode, I design a practice for you from your progress. The practice has four parts:
1. Fix the questions you recently missed.
2. Drill times tables you make lots of mistakes on.
3. Sharpen the tables you mess up more than others.
4. Practice questions that are harder than you're used to.

You need to answer 100 questions before I make a practice session. I update the practice based on your progress.

Speed Challenge

I time how fast you answer a series of questions. After you pick a difficulty, I ask you three questions from each table in its range.
Difficulties:
Normal, 0 - 10 tables
Hard, 0 - 12 tables
Advanced, 10 - 20 tables
Insane, 20 - 30 tables

Survival Mode
- - - - - - - - - -
I test how many questions you can answer correctly in a row. 
But watch out! I make the questions harder until you mess up!

Notes
- - - - - - - - - -
Other things I can help you with:
- Personal Records: "What is my record for Survival Mode?"
- Correct Answer: "What is the correct answer?"


**Table Bounds
The lower and upper bounds set the question range for each time table.
For example, if you practice the 7's times table and set the lower bound to 8 and upper bound to 11,
I will quiz you on these 4 questions:
7 x 8
7 x 9
7 x 10
7 x 11
