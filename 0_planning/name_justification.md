My Times Tables game is my oldest, continuing project to date. I completed a Python implementation in December of 2019, and am beginning to implement it the first week of May, after a 5-month period. During construction of the .py version, I referred to the skill as "Times Tables", however this falls woefully short of the fierce branding required to compete with Alexa competitors.

While brainstorming for the skill, I began to use the name "Multiplication Madness". The name has a fun ring to it and uses the alliteration that I prize so much in Alexa names. I was happy with this name, but not overwhelmingly so. The tipping point was when I reviewed a competitor's skill: [Multiplication Mania](https://www.amazon.com/toast-Multiplication-Mania/dp/B07VG8KW7N). The skillcard employs a lot of the same tactics that I boast, though to a lesser degree:
    - Alliteration in the skillcard
    - Functions clearly separated into different sections
    - Capitalized skill name in the sample utterance
    - A bit of mystery in all of the skill functions
    - Some native speaker English writing for once - yay!

However, the one-offputting aspect of the skill was it's name: _Multiplication Mania_. This associates the skill with mania, a mental disorder with great periods of excitement. This slightly negative connotation put me off just a little bit. And this was enough to justify the use of only _positive_ words in the skill name. 

In my query for new skill names, I googled a list of words that start with 'm' and took 15 minutes reading through them. I arrived with the following candidate words:


| 'm' word candidates  |
|   :--     |
|   Mix     |
|   Mixer   |
|   Mash    |
|   Mojo    |
|   Magic   |
|   Match   |
|   *Mentor*  |
|   *Medley*  |


Two words from this list caught my attention:
1. Mentor
2. Medley

**Mentor** fits into a lot of the extra functionalities I have planned for the skill, i.e., creating a user profile and tracking your mistakes/habits. However, _mentor_ doesn't fit with all activities of the skill. Namely, the competitive Speed & Survival mode, which I find most interesting.

**Medley** adheres to the Domain-defined paradigm I used to inform my previous skill names:
    - _Ultimate Knock Knock Jokes_. The superlative ultimate indicates the best & has everything
    - _Everything Memory_. Everything indicates that it has all of the content.
A medley, a mixture of things, represents the different functions of the skill and suggests the Domain Defined paradigm that informs the skill.

_Demographic Analysis_
However, it's imperative that I also consider Demographic analysis for the skill. A multiplication skill is _likely_ to be searched for & enabled through parental guidance. At face value, parents may be more likely to enable & search for a skill named "Multiplication Mentor." However, I believe that "Medley" has face-value benefits as well. For instance, the meaning of the word itself is 'variety', which is a _staple_ in VUI design. Additionally, the word has a 'fun' connotation associated with it, especially when it's employed in music. Finally, I believe that medley will have a greater user engagement (retention/usage), if not skill enablement. The skill is to be used my children and thus should be associated with fun, varied activities. Not 

The launch intents:
> "Tell Multiplication Mentor to start Speed Challenge"

and

> "Tell Multiplication Medley to start Speed Challenge"

have different rings to them. Multiplication Medley has a more organic feel to it, and doesn't feel as forced. I also expect it to be more engaging for kids.


**Summary**:
Ultimately, Multiplication Medley was a gut choice. A lot of the reasons I use to justify it are based on assumptions without tangible evidence.
- Appeal to variety, and fun.
- "Mentor" sounds inorganic.
- Associated with Domain Defined paradigm.
