## Skill Name

|   Competitor  |   Strengths   |   Weaknesses  |
|   :--         |   :--         |   :--         |
|   Multiplication Quiz                | Descriptive & informative | Doesn't necessarily stand out  |
|   Multiplication Practice            | ^^ | ^^ |
|   Multiplication Mania               | Fun name, good alliteration | Mental illness, perjorative connotation. |
|   Amazon Math                        | Brand name. I think this is an actual Amazon skill. | Hard to argue with branding. |
|   1-2-3 Math                         | Playful name | Not very descriptive, and makes it sound like elementary counting math. |
|  Math Facts - Math Practice for Kids | Descriptive, tells a lot about the skill | I believe this is for practicing? Facts seems misleading. |

**Lessons**: 
- I like the alliteration in Multiplication Mania (Like always). Should probably stay away from negative connotation.
  - Multiplication: "Magic", "Magician", "Madness - perjorative, but fun?" NOTE: Chose Medley - fits into Domain Defined Skill Paradigm.
  - Google search word list that starts with 'M' and skim through.

|   Multiplication Practice            | A fun way for all to learn and practice multiplication facts. | Descriptive for purpose. Advertises fun aspect, which is important to me for some reason? | refers to them as Multiplication facts. Is that a locale thing? Also, doesn't really _pop_. |
|   Multiplication Mania               | Put your multiplication skills to the test through four interactive game modes. Try for a high score or, if you dare, crack the code to unlock Mania Extreme! | Challenges the user to put their skills to the test.

|   Amazon Math                        | The Amazon Math skill provides kids meaningful practice of grade-level appropriate math from Kindergarten through 5th grade. | Clear purpose, and obvious target audience.

|   1-2-3 Math                         | 1-2-3 Math, is a math challenge which tests your elementary math skills, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, comparison etc | Tells you exactly what it can do.  | Doesn't fit the theme of the fun, playful name. |
|  Math Facts - Math Practice for Kids | Math Facts provides math practice your whole family can enjoy together. | Repeats name for branding and targets family | Doesn't say anything about its functionality.  |

**Lessons**:
- May like to model heavily after Multiplication Mania - really like the style of the person who did it.
- Be descriptive of the skill functionality - at least hint @ practice & competitive modes.
- Mention characteristics that set it apart, e.g., highscores and suggesting practice.
- If I select a theme, be coherent with it. 


### Detailed Description
Contains the description, and strengths and weakness analysis for each competitor skill.

#### Multiplication Quiz
**Description**

Before starting your quiz, Alexa asks you for a range of numbers you would like to be quizzed on, as well as the number of questions she should ask you. After your quiz has ended, you can view a summary of your quiz through the Alexa App!

**Strengths**
- Clearly describes the input process and additional features, e.g., quiz summary.

**Weaknesses**
- Rather uninspiring, and doesn't clarify what you'll be quizzed on.


#### Multiplication Practice
**Description**

This skill enables anyone to learn multiplication facts in a fun and engaging way. It is fairly simple all you need to tell Alexa is up to which number you wish to practice the multiplication facts. For example, if you tell Alexa you want to practice up to 4, she will give you problems of multiplying 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s, with the numbers 1 through 12. Works great with the Echo Show.

**Strengths**
- Describes a range of multiplication tables to practice
- Advertises working with the Echo Show
- Provides an example

**Weaknesses**
- Says multiplication facts, not tables
- Describes it as 'simple', but honestly a little unintuitive that there's no way to set the lower bound multiplication table.
- Not convinced that this is 'fun' and 'engaging'.

#### Multiplication Mania!
**Description**

Choose from four game modes:

1) Pop Quiz: Alexa will ask you five questions (1-10 times tables); can you get all five right? A good option for those needing a quick test.

2) Challenge: Alexa will ask you questions at random but with increasing difficulty until you get one wrong. Try for a new high score!

3) Mania: Prove you have mastered your 1-10 times table in this game mode, where Alexa will ask you each combination of numbers once. Get them all right and receive the code to unlock Mania Extreme. Can you crack the code?

4) Mania Extreme: Good luck.


**Strengths**
- Advertises four different modes - sections signified by numbers.
- Mysterious Mania Extreme - makes you want to unlock it as a reward.
- Advertises highscore on challenge mode, with increasing difficulty.

**Weaknesses**
- Sections not clearly defined. 
- Pop quiz isn't a very convincing mode
- Not enough attention given to Challenge mode - good mode & should be advertised more!
- Mania seems like a fun way to unlock Mania Extreme

#### Amazon Math

**Description**
The Amazon Math skill offers an easy and fun way for kids to practice math. Kids choose their current grade level from Kindergarten through 5th grade and can choose from a variety of topics, including addition, multiplication, comparing, rounding, and more! Kids complete sets of 5 math problems and can choose to focus on a specific topic or do a mix of topics. Alexa keeps track of scores and progress and can increase or decrease the difficulty of a topic as needed. Alexa can even take turns counting with you, by any number, and will celebrate when you reach counting goals.

Once you're in the skill, you can use the following commands to help you navigate:

Repeat/Say it again - Hear the question again

Change Topic - Alexa will switch to a different, grade-appropriate topic

Harder/Easier- Alexa will move you up or down in difficulty

List all Topics - Find out all the different topics you can choose from

What's my score? - Get the total score for the session

Change Grade - If another user from a different grade wants to play

**Strengths**
- describes fun and easy way
- clearly defines audience
- advertises features: tracking scores, progress, & increasing difficulty. 
- Domain-defined functionality.

**Weaknesses**
- Wordy & a bit overwhelming
- odd formatting for the commands section

####  1-2-3 Math

**Description**

1-2-3 Math is a math challenge which tests your elementary mathematics skills, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, comparison, etc. There are three modes easy, medium and hard with increasing levels of difficulty. We store the state of your game throughout the day. So, if you can't answer the question within the allotted time, you can always come back when you are ready and continue from where you left off.

You get one point for every correct question. Scores are calculated for each difficulty level separately. Check back regularly to maintain your lead in the game. All scores are reset at the end of the day.

Extension Packs:

This skill offers one time purchases of premium content in the form of extension packs. These extension packs increase the variety of questions in the respective difficulty level.


Here are the things you can say, once you initialize the skill.

Repeat/Say Again - To hear the question again
Help - To get detailed instructions
Score - To get today's scores
Change Level to Easy/Medium/Hard - To change the difficulty level to one of the options


Good luck!


**Strengths**

- Stores the state of the game, so can log back in and answer the question.
- Domain defined for math: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, comparison, etc.
- Provides list of commands to start the skill

**Weaknesses**
- Spacing is a _bit_ wonky.
- First paragraph presents lots of different ideas together and it's easily confusing.
- A bit repetitive with the language about 'difficulty level'.

#### Math Facts - Math Practice for Kids
**Description**

Math Facts gives you practice for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Problems come in sets of five. If you get enough of them right, Alexa will give you a silly message of congratulations. This skill makes math practice fun for the whole family!

The skill has been refined through extensive kid testing for accuracy and precision in listening to responses. Try it out and see the results!

**Strengths**
- Defines domain and problem set size
- Reflects on extensive kid testing for listening
- advertises to try out and see results of testing

**Weaknesses**
- Advertises silly message as a quality feature??
- "refined through extensive kid testing" sounds a bit suspicious.

|   1-2-3 Math                         | “Alexa, Open one two three” | Brand name. | Capitalization is off. one two three spelled here, but not in skillname. No consistency. |
|  Math Facts - Math Practice for Kids |  “Alexa, open Math Facts.” “Alexa, ask Math Facts for some addition problems.” “Alexa, tell Math Facts to start multiplication practice.” | Fantastic. Capitalizes brand name each time, uses variety, and advertises different functions. | No critiques.  |

**Lessons**

- Advert different functionalities
- MAYBE, try and re-arrange the brand name @ the end of the sentence, but not sure that even maps to intent?? Need to test myself and decide if the name placement should be prioritized.

### Comments
Comments for each skill. Comments are gathered as Strengths and Weaknesses. Analysis is presented in the lessons section.

#### Multiplication Quiz
**Strengths**
- We like that we can select range and # of questions.

**Weaknesses**
- Reprompt timeout is too short. Does not repeat the question at reprompt. Does not repeat the question when asked to "repeat". Answered 4x3 five times in a row?? No visual on Echo Show. Often misunderstands the "range" response at setup. Overall it's very frustrating... I am considering writing my own skill in which the interaction will be much more intuitive.
- Quiz is good for my 4th-grader, although he could use more time for some questions.
When the results are sent to my kindle fire, there is a typo in the title: Multiplcation
-As my daughter is having an issue with multiplication, it would be great if it was possible to extend the time allowed to answer the question. As it is, she struggles answering in the given time and gets even more nervious when alexa says time is almost up. However, that being said this is a great simple app.

**Lessons**
- Provide option for range & question #
- Change reprompt time - maybe add a pause before reprompt.
- Avoid duplicates
- Show the question on the Simple Card

#### Multiplication Practice
**Strengths**
- I love that it uses different formats for the questions. I wish you could set a number of questions to stop after instead of it continuing endlessly.

**Lessons**
- Include different format questions in Practice modes, e.g., "What is" "Do you know", etc.


#### Multiplication Mania

**Lessons**
- Some good skill just don't get credit :(


#### Amazon Math
**Strengths**
- great skill becuase it gives you all the time in the world to solve problems. unlike other math skills that rush kids and dont give time to answer with amazon math it goes into sleep mode that you can restart after you’re done solving and it goes back to the same problem you were on. would be perfect if it recognized differnt people and what level they left off.
- 

**Weaknesses**
- can no longer use this skill because alexa always tells us “Sometting went wrong, please try starting Amazon Math again”. It was our favorite math skill when we could use but but reporting the issue does nothing, we have gotten no respone after weeks. shame.
- kids get frustrated because alexa dont give enogh time to answer.
- My two boys both like shouting the answers. My youngest always lags behind my older son so Alexa concatenates them both and claims the answer is wrong, even though they're both giving the correct answer. Would like to see this skill more intuitive in recognizing different voices.


**Lessons**
- Can implement a sleep mode, & save all attributes. This may be useful for more complex skills. However, the purpose of this skill is quick mental math. Not prolongued practice with rote multiplication by paper.
- Having different competitive modes will let people compete with each other.

#### 1-2-3 Math
**Strengths**
- Honestly, just overwhelming support for this skill. Kind of scary considering I didn't find the skill card very promising.


#### Math Facts - Math Practice for Kids
**Weaknesses**
- We need to be able to practice a certain set of the math facts and Alexa cant access that. For example, the 3 x ?, multiplication facts.
- It was very easy . Can you make it more difficult?
- It would be helpful to be able to personalize for different skill levels

**Lessons**
- Most users want the difficulty to be harder. My skill handles this by pitting the user against themselves (time and survival).
