    Contains standardized tuple lists to reference in the skill.

    NOTE: 
    This module was intended to contain cross-module data message tuples (MTs). 
    During implementation, data was stored in relevant modules for convenience. 
    Need to either refactor other modules to place data here, or delete this module.
